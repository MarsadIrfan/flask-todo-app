# ✅ Flask To-Do App with Login

Welcome to the **Flask To-Do App** — a beautifully simple task manager built with 💖 using Flask, HTML, CSS, and SQLite. With support for user sign-up and login, you'd expect everyone to get their own list... but surprise! 🎉 **Everyone sees the same To-Do list.** Yes, really. More on that below. 😅

## ✨ Features

- 🧾 **Add & Delete Tasks** — A sleek and minimal UI with buttons that just work
- 🔐 **User Authentication** — Sign up and log in with securely encrypted passwords using Werkzeug
- 🛠️ **Flask + SQLite** — Fast, lightweight backend with elegant frontend
- 🎨 **Clean & Neat UI** — Simple, effective, and easy on the eyes
- 🤝 **One List to Rule Them All** — All users share the same to-do list. Unintentionally intentional.

## 🚧 My Little "Oops" (a.k.a. Shared To-Do List) 😅

> Originally, the app was meant to be multi-user — but I *accidentally* made it so that **everyone logs into a shared list**.  
>   
> It became a weirdly fun feature — login as anyone, and you’ll still see the same to-dos. Great for roommates? A family dashboard? A public TODO leaderboard? Who knows!  
>   
> Feel free to fork and fix it... or embrace the chaos 😄
